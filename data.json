    "How it connects to the theme of Shelter": "This artwork intricately combines urban architecture with reflections, presenting a layered view of a bustling interior against the backdrop of residential apartments. The glass facade acts as both a transparent barrier and a reflective surface, blurring the line between inside and outside, private and public. The interplay of lights and structures creates a visual metaphor for the theme of \"Shelter,\" illustrating how modern spaces protect yet expose individuals to external environments. The apartment blocks in the reflection suggest permanence and home, while the mall interior highlights transient spaces where people seek refuge or connection. This duality invites viewers to consider what shelter means in an urban context — not just physical protection but also emotional solace within the complex tapestry of city life.",

This series draws its title from Sigmund Freud’s Beyond the Pleasure Principle, where Freud introduces the concepts of the life and death drives, suggesting that the life drive ultimately serves the death drive. For me, this theory provides a framework to explore compulsive and self-destructive behaviors often observed in cycles of addiction—a way to theorise personal experience.\n \n In Pleasure Drive, automobile parts become metaphors for the \"live fast, die young\" joyride mentality often associated with addiction.

It suggests how the things we rely on for safety, whether physical or emotional can sometimes fail us.

It reminds of the struggle the travellers had on their perilous ventures into the unknown and of the struggle they faced once they arrived to seemingly safe shores. Many of them lost their lives on the way and many managed to reach Europe they headed to from their continents. This jacket was the artefact they held onto as the weaves threatened to swallow them into the depth of the sea and it allowed them to be visible by the passing vessels.

Titled after the 1972 book of essays by Gregory Bateson, the second exhibition highlighted creative and critical engagement with the social crisis of displacement and migration in relation to the environmental crisis. David Cross, the curator wrote: “Displacement and Migration are rather abstract terms that could describe the movement of water by a boat, or the seasonal flight of birds. Such cool terminology may help to counter the inflammatory rhetoric of the private media, politicians and others who stand to gain from policies that exacerbate the crises.",

The piece is composed of a series of intricate lines and shapes that form faces and a heart binding them together. These forms gaze down and across a cityscape of rooftops, symbolizing the various layers and perspectives of what shelter means. The use of bold lines and contrasting colors creates a dynamic visual narrative that explores the concept of refuge and safety. The faces, though abstract, convey emotions of longing and curiosity, emphasizing the theme of observing life from an external vantage point. This painting invites viewers to reflect on the dichotomy between the warmth and security of being inside and the detached observation from the outside.",

We were forced further into our homes, and into isolation. Finding safe havens both physically and mentally to escape and find security.\n \n \n \n The work represents those feelings. Living in this shelter, finding a wavering mix of joy, hope, confusion, desolation and rebirth in a continuous cycle. Pushing back against the dark clouds with positivity and imagination, whilst battling the loss and reimagining of one’s identity.\n \n \n \n Although, this may seem like a thing of the past, hard to comprehend and something many no longer want to confront, for many, we still live in shelter today",

I discovered this and other mediaeval medical manuscripts during a research residency at the Wellcome Collection. The Art of Dying combines elements of illuminated manuscripts and printed texts with clothes and bedclothes.

She was taken from her village and made to work in a forced labour camp until the end of the war.\n \n \n \n The tree represents how she grew, thrived and survived. The tree is made up for the colours of her homeland, and those of Australia where she immigrated. The figure has tears of both happiness and sadness, as it reaches under the shelter of the tree, embracing both worlds that make up her life. She misses her homeland, but she is is happy for the safety ad shelter of her new life half a world away. The embroidery on the white panels represent the memories and connections she had with both of her worlds.",

I have to keep re arranging and sorting to help me calm down and make sense of the world.\n \n My dollhouse is still a sanctuary that I use in my art to explore my processing, it still holds my favourite toys, but it also holds my art like the photograms on the wall and it is now a method of showing others the experience of autism.",

As someone with ADHD, my process embraces a framework of chaos and control, layering fragments of text and texture into a cohesive yet dynamic whole.\n \n \n \n The title, \"Elephant NOT in the Room,\" is a nod to being excluded from spaces where I might belong, yet refusing to accept that invisibility. The work’s sprawling dimensions assert my presence, an embodiment of claiming space and declaring, I am here.\n \n \n \n At its core, the process of creating this piece has been a refuge—an act of escape and self-sheltering. Through piecing together disparate elements, I found a place to process emotions, to make sense of fragmentation, and to temporarily step outside the noise of everyday life. Each stitch and layer became an act of reclaiming control and constructing my own sanctuary.\n \n \n \n This work is not just about claiming space in the world but also about carving out space for myself, where I feel seen, safe, and whole.",

I realised that without safety I didn't feel sheltered.\n \n \n \n The broken locks, still covered in fingerprint powder were painted in watercolour. I then crushed it to create a new narrative, turning the feelings of fear into something more optimistic and hopeful. This crushed work becomes the still life subject which empowers the transfiguration and resulting abstract oil painting. The abstraction of the original images on the paper transforms the negative feelings that these objects trigger, into a positive association which comes with the practice of painting and making art.

    "How it connects to the theme of Shelter": "I made this when my life was falling apart. I had left my marital home, ripped my family apart and had recently lost my grandmother. My new flat, devoid of any memories, didn't feel like home. During this period, I was going to the beach to swim and collect bits of rubbish. The beach became a second home, and, in the absence of any suitable ritual to recognise the process I was going through, I made a series of shrines featuring beach waste – transforming the sad and lost plastic into something of value. This shrine features personal domestic textiles and ‘failed’ cyanotypes. I felt I had failed at my marriage, failed at a new relationship and failed at connecting with my grandmother before she died – but this quilt offered a spiritual home to put these feelings and offer thanks to the beach as a home when I desperately needed it.",

They can be empty or full, waiting to receive or holding intangible concepts like knowledge, feelings or memories. Honestly the viewer brings their own perspective to them. The figure is also slightly mysterious. Is it a feminine form? Is she pregnant? What does she suggest to the viewer? Could she also be a vessel? A vessel for knowledge or fruitfulness perhaps? Her head is inclined, is she happy? Sad? Introspective?\n \n Just as there are many layers to this painting, many of them hidden, so the images are layered with symbolism, unique to the viewer.

Humans are innately driven to recreate such havens, from the womb to the spaces we build in adulthood.\n \n \n \n This connects to the theme of shelter in a world where safety feels progressively fragile. Shelter can signify a structure, a refuge, or the act of offering protection. It embodies safety, belonging, and sanctuary—core human needs.\n \n \n \n A fleeing mother seeking safety for her children reflects the universal quest for shelter, echoing the primal haven of the womb. This painting explores fragility, resilience, and the enduring human desire for security amidst uncertainty.",

The maps trace connections between spaces of the past, present, and potential future, linking the artist's identity to her homeland and new spaces through memories, relationships, and storytelling.\n \n \n \n Shelter emerges as personal security found in memory, identity, and belonging.

The old lady belonged to a class called, \"crawlers.\" Crawlers were people who had given up trying, they were so depressed they were just waiting to die. In 1870 the British Empire held 79% of all the world's wealth. Within one mile of the City of London, the richest and most powerful place on Earth, there was desperate poverty equal in its misery to any far-flung place of the Empire. The Policemen in the image represents Authority looking away.",

    "Content": "α II Vulva\n \n \n \n Part of the Alpha series, inspired by Carl Jung’s concept of individuation, where each sculpture reflects a unique stage in the journey towards self-realisation and integration.\n \n \n \n α II Vulva embodies the multifaceted essence of shelter through its intricate interplay of organic forms and protective structures. Its curving, tubular forms intertwine and envelop, evoking a sense of both containment and flow—an echo of the nurturing embrace of a sanctuary. The grounded, textured surface, reminiscent of ancient stone, contrasts with the smoother, sinuous elements, symbolising the delicate balance between vulnerability and resilience.\n \n \n \n The sculpture features two bubbled forms, like protective eggs, anchoring the piece. These elements act as memory stones, representing the enduring facets of identity and heritage, grounding the work in notions of internal refuge and resilience. The protective shapes, with their fragmented textures, evoke a primal connection to nature, creating a sense of belonging and safety.\n \n \n \n In the journey of individuation, shelter becomes both a necessity and a metaphor—offering spaces of protection and self-acceptance as we confront and integrate the multifaceted layers of the self. This piece explores the tension between protection and exposure, inviting viewers to consider how shelter—both internal and external—shapes our sense of security and wholeness.",

    "How it connects to the theme of Shelter": "α II Vulva delves into the delicate balance between vulnerability and resilience, encapsulating the concept of shelter through its intertwining organic forms. Inspired by Carl Jung’s individuation process, the piece reflects the journey toward self-realisation, where shelter emerges as both a physical refuge and an emotional anchor. Its protective, enveloping structures evoke a sanctuary for introspection, growth, and self-acceptance.\n \n The work invites viewers to reflect on shelter as a fundamental human need—an internal and external space where we find safety and belonging. By exploring the tension between protection and exposure, α II Vulva asks how the shelters we create, both tangible and intangible, shape our identity and sense of wholeness in an ever-shifting world.",

    "Content": "This video documents a personal performance art experiment I conducted during a turbulent period of my life. As a person living abroad for the first time in 2023, I found myself overwhelmed by an unfamiliar culture, academic pressures, and personal struggles. In this state of vulnerability, I faced feelings of homelessness—not in the physical sense, but as a person adrift, without a sense of safety, belonging, or purpose.\n \n Amid family conflicts, depression, and relentless anxiety, I struggled to find a sense of stability. The sleepless nights, compounded by the stress of financial instability and job rejections, left me feeling as though I had nowhere to turn. These challenges prompted me to question what \"shelter\" truly meant—not only as a physical space but as a state of being where one feels secure, accepted, and supported.\n \n In response, I transformed my pain into an act of artistic inquiry. For three hours, I stayed on the streets of London, with a board that revealed my internal struggles, presenting myself as a wanderer lost in life. My aim was to explore whether anyone would notice or care, and to question how society perceives and responds to individuals in need.\n \n To my astonishment, the kindness and empathy of strangers became my temporary shelter. Conversations with passersby, small gestures of compassion, and moments of connection offered me a sanctuary in the chaos of my mind. Their willingness to engage with my vulnerability gave me hope, reminding me that shelter is not only about physical protection—it is also about the emotional refuge we find in human connection.\n \n When I shared the video of this performance on Chinese social media, it resonated with many young people who saw reflections of their own struggles. For some, it became a reminder that even in moments of despair, the potential for connection and support exists. Through this work, I hope to inspire dialogue about the broader concept of shelter, urging viewers to consider the ways we can offer sanctuary to one another in a world that often feels isolating and uncertain.",

    "How it connects to the theme of Shelter": "This artwork reflects on the concept of 'shelter' through the lens of my experience as an Asian individual navigating the uncertainties of life abroad. In 2023, I faced a profound sense of being “rootless”—adrift in a foreign culture, overwhelmed by life pressures, and unsure of where my future would lead. This performance art experiment on the streets of London was an attempt to externalize my internal struggles and explore how society perceives individuals in states of vulnerability. As a member of a marginalized community, I grappled with questions of belonging and purpose, feeling caught between worlds yet grounded in none. The unexpected kindness of strangers offered me a temporary emotional refuge, reminding me that 'shelter' is more than a physical space—it is also the hope and connection we find through shared humanity.",

AA and other recovery rooms offer shelter. Without our addiction, life is painful and overwhelming at first. It through meeting with others we find our queer family.\n \n \n \n I am an artist in addiction recovery and I made this film and music (and installation, see other images in my gallery) as a response to being two years sober.

    "Content": "Spoons (After Carolyn Lazard), (2023) is a moving image work with accompanying textile banner and spoons sculptures based upon Spoons Theory; which uses spoons as a visualisation of the disparity in energy reserves between disabled and abled people. Though a disabled and abled person will start the day with the same number of spoons, an abled person may only need 1 spoon to undertake an activity such as going to the shops, while a disabled person might use 4 spoons. In this way, disabled people deplete their spoons (or energy reserves) far quicker and thus have to be conscious about how they spend their spoons. Spoons theory has translated into a colloquialism within crip communities – “I’m out of spoons” or “I’m going to spend my spoons on you.”\n \n On screen, spoons are papier-mâchéd in newspaper clippings related to COVID-19, as an acknowledgement of a new generation of people living with chronic illness and disability as a result of long-COVID. While Jamila covers the spoons, placing them down on the table, two hands begin to come and take them away, continually depleting Jamila's work. The act indicates the tireless additional labour involved in being disabled and how we are always running out of spoons/energy.\n \n \n \n Over a 6 month period, Jamila exchanged voicenotes with three disabled artists – Leah Clements, Carolyn Lazard and Bella Milroy – about their personal relationships to spoons theory, which has then been turned into an original score using an algorithm by sound artist Felix Taylor. Thinking around voicenotes as a form of holding commune in crip communities, particularly for those who are bed or housebound.\n \n \n \n The work is made in reference to Carolyn Lazard's 2018 moving image, Crip Time, and mirrors the same bird-eyes view shot of a table cloth. Crip Time acts as a visual and research touchstone; influencing an exploration of how energy and time manifest themselves within crip communities.\n \n \n \n Accompanying the work is a handmade textile banner, made up of patchwork squares interpreting the oral histories and appliqué text stating \"I'm out of spoons\" and the spoon sculptures created during the film.\n \n \n \n Fittingly, while making the work, the artist was continually out of spoons.",

The workshops were populated and facilitated by women with autism and adhd which makes it safe and easier to be authentic and discuss parts of the experience of living with one or both conditions, using art as a medium for investigating masking, loneliness and connectedness. Specifically, the film is focussed on exploring how the conditions impacted connections, work life, motherhood and art-making in relation to people-pleasing due to socialisation as girls, hormones and dysregulation, masking neurodivergent traits and social burnout, sensory challenges, organisation challenges, time management and executive function and understanding others. Those working with neurodivergent women around these specific issues can benefit from seeing how art forms communities for these women to explore topics and create pathways to connection without the need for too much art skill, while loved ones of neurodivergent women can gain further insight into challenges and better understanding. Ultimately, the film sparks an emotional journey into the shared human experience of these women and how they found a safe space, or shelter if you will, through the project.

It wasn’t just any shelter; it was a tent made out of sheets, held up by a piece of wood. This simple structure became my fortress, my hideaway, and my adventure zone.\n \n \n \n I remember the excitement of gathering all the necessary materials. I would carefully select the sturdiest sheets from the linen closet, making sure they were large enough to drape over my bed. The piece of wood, often a broomstick or a spare rod, served as the central support, transforming my bed into a magical tent.\n \n \n \n Once the tent was up, I would crawl inside with a flashlight and a stack of my favourite books. The soft glow of the flashlight created a warm, inviting atmosphere, perfect for reading stories of far-off lands and daring heroes. Sometimes, I would invite my stuffed animals to join me, turning the tent into a bustling campsite.\n \n \n \n The best part of my shelter was the sense of adventure it brought. Inside that tent, I could be anyone and go anywhere. I was an explorer in the jungle, a knight in a castle, or a sailor on a ship. The possibilities were endless, and my imagination ran wild.\n \n \n \n Looking back, those moments spent in my makeshift tent were some of the happiest of my childhood. They taught me the joy of creativity and the magic of turning the ordinary into the extraordinary. My shelter up on my bed was more than just a plaything; it was a gateway to a world of wonder and adventure.\n \n \n \n Size A3\n \n \n \n This is a Print. off my original water colour.

I wanted to dig down deeper into what shelter really means at it's most basic, what is it like to not have shelter. After observing I could see that even when people do not have a physical or emotional shelter they will still try to shelter themselves, often with their hands. Crossed arms, a head held in hands, a hand over a mouth or ears. This is when I realised that the absolute and ultimate shelter is our own bodies, and how they allow us to interact with the world. I wanted to draw a piece that would celebrate the body and all that it could do, and I wrote a poem to accompany it too.",

    "Content": "Two receipt printers sit opposite each other. They are some distance apart but connected by a single long loop of twisting paper. Methodically and rhythmically, each printer is printing the same quote onto the same piece of paper. Slowly, as they overprint each other’s message and obscure its meaning, the process becomes more central to the work's performance, as if questioning the ease of meaning that the quote once offered.\n \n Inevitably, wear and tear on the loop eventually causes a paper jam, at which point an attendant intervenes, removes the damaged section, and rejoins the shortened loop. They offset the newly shortened loop by moving the printers slightly closer together, and the printing process is resumed. This process is repeated again and again until there is no longer enough paper to stretch between the two printers, which are finally united in failure.\n \n For me, anything can be a form of shelter, it just depends on what it is we are trying to take shelter from. For me the only meaningful shelter I have found from the turbulence of my mid-life diagnosis for ADHD has been in realising I need to accept myself for who I am rather than who I thought I was meant to be. Accepting my vulnerabilities, fallibilities and differences (and forgiving myself for having them) has been a long and slow, yet empowering process. My diagnosis has forced me to acknowledge that not everything that seems to make sense for others, makes sense for me (when I look at this quote now all I ever think now is \"yes, but for how long?\").

    "How it connects to the theme of Shelter": "For me, anything can be a form of shelter, it just depends on what it is we are trying to take shelter from. For me the only meaningful shelter I have found from the turbulence of my mid-life diagnosis for ADHD has been in realising I need to accept myself for who I am rather than who I thought I was meant to be. Accepting my vulnerabilities, fallibilities and differences (and forgiving myself for having them) has been a long and slow, yet empowering process. My diagnosis has forced me to acknowledge that not everything that seems to make sense for others, makes sense for me. It has also meant acknowledging that ultimately, nothing is more universal and human than failure even in our digital age. What matters though is the compassion and support that we show ourselves and each other when we confront such moments, and in so doing help to provide each other shelter in these challengingtime",

They were inspired by the unseen, hard-to-reach spaces, where myths, fears and the unconscious reside.\n \n \n \n When creating the series of sculptures were initially inspired by Indigenous legends of what dwells within the confines of caves and underground spaces; how these spaces were not only spaces of myths, and gateways to other places but also essential places to seek shelter from the elements.",

    "How it connects to the theme of Shelter": "“Erosion” reflects the fragile nature of the relationship between humanity and the natural environment, a fine balance which we largely take for granted, providing shelter and food to communities through proactive and responsible guardianship of the land.\n \n This mixed media landscape piece is brought to life using alcohol ink and coloured pencil on wood, following the beauty and natural grain of the wood. It is an organic and sustainable piece which creates an immersive experience. In this sense it moves beyond the visual and challenges our thoughts and feelings about shelter and our basic needs.\n \n “Erosion” reflects the powerful aftermath when tipping point is reached through soil and coastal erosion- the catastrophic consequences of climate change on communities and lives caused by extreme flooding, loss of shelter and pollution. “Erosion” captures the loneliness of the barren landscape.",

I shall be printing and doing more mixed drawing and paintings to provide a sense of place. The creation of surface pattern together with colours and movement is a wonderful challenge. I shall be adding some visual “props” for this body of work. Jetty, boat and moorings etc and these may sit well with the project overall.\n \n \n \n Appearing unpredictably fluid yet meticulously composed, this creation delves into the paradox of movement within a seemingly static medium. Layers of cerulean blue, teal, and indigo coalesce, reflecting the depth and fluidity of water. Textured brushstrokes and layered techniques mimic the undulating motion of waves, resulting in an engaging shift of light and shadow. Variations in hue and the intricate patterns formed by the brushwork impart both energy and tranquility. The visual experience allows viewers to immerse themselves in the forms and rich shades, suggesting the soothing ebb and flow of the ocean.",

    "How it connects to the theme of Shelter": "- \"Out of the Blue\" is not just a visual ode to the clear, pristine waters that grace our planet; it is a profound statement on the indispensable shelter that these vast bodies of water provide. Water is the genesis of all life, offering solace, sustenance, and safety to countless species, including humanity. This piece invites the viewer to ponder the sanctuary that the Earth's waters offer to marine life, safeguarding delicate ecosystems beneath their serene surfaces. Moreover, it underscores the role of water as a fundamental shelter for humans, not only in its most direct forms of nourishment and physical refuge but also as a crucial shield against the advancing threats of global warming. By portraying the water's unblemished beauty, \"Out of the Blue\" serves as a poignant reminder of what is at stake — our ultimate shelter and protector that we must preserve for future generations.",

Created during an Outside In \"Make Art: Online\" workshop, it is a reflection of personal ongoing physical, psychological and emotional journeys that have been, are and will be.\n \n \n \n Image Description: A black and white tavern with brightly coloured windows walks on grey bird legs across a landscape of light green grass and beautiful blue, cloudy skies. A small person with a guitar case hovers, turned as if to enter the tavern's door. There are bushes either side of the tavern by the long grass, and a black and white wild cat, akin to an ocelot, ambles alongside on the left of the piece. The tavern, cat and artwork are all outlined in gold. The artwork is shaped like an arched window, bordered in black.",

    "How it connects to the theme of Shelter": "Baba Yaga has often been ostracised in folklore for her complex moral compass, but also her independence and personal autonomy. She is enigmatic: a mischievous mediator of life and death, a fierce guardian of nature, more reactive than passive in her actions, unapologetically crossing traditional social confines of femininity in folklore. Her home – a humble abode perched atop bird legs – is both an outward reflection of her unconventionality and an inward personal haven, a safe shelter. My artwork is a depiction of this home and the connection I feel with the feminist interpretation of Baba Yaga’s folklore: she is a woman who has found her path and is unafraid to walk it. This home is me – I am a walking shelter, everything I have been and am contained within, a power to harness, to inform my future and develop my growth as a woman deserving of autonomy, agency and independence.",

Its absorption in a reality created to numb out the pain of mental illness and abuse both physical and mental from a sick father and neglectful mother. It's funny, joyful and mysterious. TV shows I remember as a child placed without and within. Ads for child safety crossing the roads of life. A train station waiting for the train of love and care to arrive. An emotion piece that I keep adding too.",

This work represents a significant moment of stillness and stability found while living in Birmingham. For the first time, the artist has been able to stay in one place long enough to cultivate roots, allowing both personal and artistic growth to flourish. The studio is depicted as a safe haven—a space for creative practice and reflection, free from the instability of the past. This artwork is a celebration of finding security and a place to call home, embodying the essence of ‘Shelter’ as both a physical space and an emotional refuge.",

    "How it connects to the theme of Shelter": "As someone who is a very neurodiverse individual the thing that fascinated me whilst painting this was the way the ‘bubbles’ pieces each other perfectly creating other interlocking bubbles. What strikes me now is how we are all living in our own perceptive bubble of reality and I guess this painting could signify finding your tribe or finding other people with bubbles of perception that are similar enough to yours to lock in for a while and really compliment each other.\n \n \n \n There is a strength there in those geometrical corners with all that colour and boldness; I wanted to strike a contrast almost like a zoomed in effect at one corner and a zoomed out effect at the other. Again, this is all a great allegory for consciousness and the many levels of it and how we as individual perception bubbles help to make up the whole.",

By repurposing personal garments, this tent reflects the intimate relationship between my own body and the search for safety.\n \n \n \n The tent embodies the precariousness of shelter, particularly for women who face unique barriers in securing stable housing. Through its form and material, the piece addresses the hidden struggles of homelessness and exploitation, including the harsh realities of “sex for rent” and the pressure to remain in violent, unsafe living conditions due to a lack of alternatives. Embroidered stories woven into the fabric give voice to these often-invisible experiences, bringing to light the vulnerability and resilience of women caught in cycles of housing insecurity.",

The Guardian to some may seem rather menacing, but to others may be seen as a gentle presence kindly keeping watch, balanced precariously on the small structure.

    "Content": "‘Ned’ is a hand embroidered wall piece exploring the artists relationship with their emotions.\n \n \n \n The piece is based off of a three month illustration project that the artist used to document scenes and thoughts from daily life that they felt offered an insight into their inner world.\n \n \n \n The illustration that inspired ‘Ned’ was created during a period of homelessness and in the company of a good friend. Where physical shelter was temporary and unstable, the artist looked for other aspects of life to find the stability and safety associated with housing or a ‘home’. This was found for a moment one afternoon where the artist was able to take shelter in their imagination and the comfort of a good friend.\n \n \n \n A handful of illustrations that felt most meaningful were then translated into stitch, with ‘Ned’ being one of them.\n \n \n \n Through the use of soft materials and vibrant colours, the artist aims to replicate the comfort, safety, and joy felt by the artist on the afternoon of ‘Ned’(s) creation.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Techniques used in this piece: tambour, needle felting, surface stitching, canvaswork, raised/stumpwork, and Goldwork.\n \n \n \n Materials included: calico, silk, felt, glass beads, sequins, wool felt fibres, stranded cotton, wool, metallic threads, kid leather, and metal threads.",

    "How it connects to the theme of Shelter": "The initial idea for Ned was created whilst I was homeless. I was really struggling with the instability and un-safety of not having a home and moving a lot. In a desperate attempt to try and gain some control over the situation, I looked at other area’s of everyday life I could try and gain that feeling of safety and stability that comes with housing or a ‘home’. It was hard, but I was able to find a glimmer of this one afternoon when I went to see my friend Becky. The familiarity and comfort of her provided a moment for me to feel safe and stable, giving me the space to tune into my imagination and be creative. Here with her help, Ned was born and I saw that despite not having a home, I could gain some shelter from what was going on by moving into my imagination, and being comforted by a friend.",

Many disabled people feel not seen and invisible, the empty powerchair represents this emotion, how some people tend to see the powerchair and not the person. A person’s presence is more than their disability. The open footplates sends an invitation to sit in the chair, like walking in my shoes, to have a glimpse into my lived experiences, offering the opportunity to step into the shoes of the person who would normally occupy it. The shoes left behind metaphorically represent the presence of a person once there, provoking the idea of humanising a disabled person's identity. I purposefully used a monochromatic colour palette to support the symbolism and emotional impact.\n \n \n \n Medium: willow charcoal and gouache paint on a wooden panel.",

Through this intimate exploration their properties and potential, the structure, fibres, layers and pores that give them their uniqueness are discovered.

My flat felt like a safe space, but I realised it had become a prison. I didn't open my curtains for years, until one day I noticed light coming through the top of my closed curtains, in the shape of a bird. I felt an impulse to open the curtains, and I was bathed in warm sunshine. I followed the impulse to create this artwork. The centre of the picture is my centre, and the bird is the spirit of creativity, or perhaps the Holy Spirit reaching out to me. I then imagined times of sadness and tears, like rain, encouraging seeds to grow, producing more colour and releasing my creativity. I realised that I wanted to reconnect nature, the world, and the people around me.",

Its story reflects the ingenuity and resilience of people striving to create shelter within their means, adapting spaces to serve as safe havens amidst changing circumstances. Perched over flowing waters, the Bridge House symbolizes how individuals will go to great lengths to find or build secure spaces, transforming the resources available to them into places of refuge. Its enduring presence, set against a natural landscape, underscores the timeless human connection to shelter, resilience, and adaptability, making it a powerful representan",

    "Content": "Taken from photographs of Brighton, the city I live in, I intended to put across not just the physical concept of shelter, but also the parts of city life which offer us shelter from the more unpleasant occurrences and events, often hidden from sight. Watching the city from its centre where I lived for some time without fixed address, I wanted the image to be unexpectedly active; the lasting shelter provided by a busy culture and bustling streets. It is the hectic nature of its streets and the lively day-to-day interactions which stand out, keeping us occupied.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n The screen-printed image is drawn over digitally and contains remnants of poetry written through its layers. Pieces of Preston Street and the Kingsway Seafront Road are intermingled, and the i360 leans inward at a precarious angle, interposing itself on the picture, one of the city's many recent developments. On one hand, it celebrates our UK cities, their busy cultures and growth. But I also cracked the glass to symbolise the facade under which the more troublesome aspects of life in our cities lie. However, only the facade is broken. Its cracks are easily fixed. Hopefully, the viewer is invited to look underneath, but there is also the promise of the future; a cacophony of traffic fills the promenade and the modern style of the image invites the observer to wonder what will become of its roads - and the people who live in it. I would like the image to invite its viewers to consider how our urban future will look and how we should shape it.\n \n ____________\n \n I constructed this image from digitally manipulated and drawn-over photographs, then screen-printed the image in acrylics mixed with a screen-printing medium. Parts of the picture have been drawn over and each layer has been arranged in vector software before being printed out and transferred to an A3+ printing screen using photosensitive screen emulsion. The layers were lined up with a clear plastic registration sheet.\n \n \n \n Measurements are for the artwork itself and not the frame.",

During that period, I'd see the town centre active at different times, often through close to twenty-four hours of its day. While many people were looking for shelter in its streets, hostels and backpackers' lodges, the city itself offered a form of shelter, not just from the elements, but its busy nature provided shelter from disruptive and unwanted events. Its occupants perhaps took a lasting form of shelter in its busy culture, sometimes, from their everyday lives. The picture also features more traditional symbolisms of shelter; blocks of flats, vehicles, and rain and shelter, representing the clearer concept of shelter from the elements, but the less predictable elements stood out to me most, seeming the most striking, and often just as important.",

These quotes are contrasted with illustrated photographs from my experience of the space, the trees, the \"empty\" building they discussed as 35 people were actively and legally living there.\n \n \n \n For the purposes of the Shelter exhibition, these 3 zines would be housed in a custom A4 folder.",

    "Content": "LOVE, THE BLACK TYPE, Hope River, 2024, acrylic on paper, 42 x 29.7\n \n \n \n This painting is part of a series inspired by the following short story by Hope River.\n \n \n \n It’s 4OO hours and snowing somewhere in Oklahoma.\n \n \n \n A petrol station is the only glow against a backdrop void of the five senses. The peace is unsettling. It feels like we’re at Legba’s crossroads, staring into the past, present, and future simultaneously. But this shrine-like petrol station, with its sickly-sweet façade, fluorescent light buzz, and air of otherworldly worship, makes the prospect of stepping into the void, ok-ish.\n \n \n \n Two strangers search for their seats on a Greyhound chariot parked out front, it’s passing into the void, into everywhere but nowhere. Checking seat numbers against the ones blazing on their phones every step, they slumber through the aisle. Sleepiness and vigilance, traits inherent to both. He’s in 20a, she’s 20b. Two black seats right at the back. Really, is race still a thing in the afterlife or just a home comfort during your transition? For some reason, rows 17, 18 and 19 are missing. The two share a look that says, “just keep movin’, we know this shit already, it, it don’t matter.” After a couple of rough starts - something to do with a wrong soul count - the chariot makes it tracks.\n \n \n \n A lot is going on. Cotton shaped weed clouds fill the air, we hope Snoop is here to lighten the mood. The driver loses his nut, screaming federal laws as if it matters where we’re going – he still thinks we’re down there, bless him. Kids cry, pissed their routines have been fucked up because of an 8-hour delay. A broken toilet door hits and whips, fanning shit directly across 20a and b.\n \n \n \n Who are these strangers? Well, he’s got swag, the geeky Kendrick kind. With chocolate skin, a slim build, and wired glasses, he sits at the edge of sensibility. Wearing a checked mantle, silky trackies, and a balaclava, the portal to his soul lies in his eyes and 4c Nappy crown. She’s bonnie, the Lianne kind. With honey skin, a slender Rwandan physique, and foresight, she sits in sensibility. Wearing a knitted shawl, smudged jeans, and her 3b crown in a knot, her smile is the portal to her soul.\n \n \n \n They share a sense of familiarity, though they’ve never crossed paths – so they think. They speak in gestures alone, use a code pre-written in their African ancestry. He passes her his Taco Bell wrapper to bin. Whilst she bins it, she passes him her half-eaten Subway. With bloodshot eyes he watches a strange ass cartoon on his phone, it makes him belly laugh. Though annoyed by the fact he isn’t wearing headphones, she’s just happy he’s found joy. He sees her trying to sleep, so he puts his phone to sleep. They share a final look that says, “sweet dreams.”\n \n \n \n Eventually, they surrender to a comfortable rest. Unapologetically nestled into each other. Legs entwined, jackets turned blankets shared; shelter. Two strangers, at the end of this life, anyway, entering one dream of no return.\n \n \n \n It’s 400 years ago and snowing everywhere, but nowhere.\n \n \n \n Dazed, they wake up. They consider trying to stand on their feet, but staying still seems like an omen of the lasting peace to come.\n \n \n \n A white candle is the only glow against a blood painted and sugar flavoured sky. Legba’s shadow enters and leaves its glow. Now, as Mr and Mrs, they still commune in gestures, this time as a strong embrace. Their time is nigh, but “it, it don’t matter.” They’re forever too starved to eat, too speechless to talk, too tired to sleep, too dead to live. When the light dies, and the white wax sets all, that is when their promise of freedom will come to be. That is when the void will envelope their being, but never destroy their shelter: their love for one another.\n \n \n \n -",

    "How it connects to the theme of Shelter": "This painting was inspired by a surreal bus trip I took during my travels across the United States. On the bus trip I found shelter and a sense of familiarity in a stranger I was sat next to - we existed intimately together for 17 hours without talking or touching. Shortly after the encounter, I wrote a short story about the bus trip, and felt a haunting connection to The Lovers by René Magritte.",

I have used oil paints for their richness and versatility, allowing me to capture the shine of the ceiling and the subtle patterns of the iron decoration over the door's glass. The piece relates to the theme of 'Shelter' in its representation of the home that I share with my Mum, a safe place where the domestic and the absurd coexist. At once, the house is very functional and ordinary, and yet otherworldly in the glowing colours and spider-like pattern cast by the lampshade. My Mum's house is a safe haven because weirdness is welcomed.",

For me, shelter is more than just a physical structure; it represents a deeper, spiritual sanctuary—one that resides in our shared humanity, kindness, forgiveness, and compassion. As the dawn light illuminates the Cathedral, it serves as a metaphor for the inner light of spirituality, offering protection, comfort, and renewal even in the darkest times.\n \n \n \n In this painting I have explored the interplay of light and shadow, where the iconic dome seems to glow from within, evoking a sense of timeless spirituality. The bold brushstrokes and abstract elements aim to capture not just the cathedral’s grand architecture but the energy and tranquillity it holds at its heart.\n \n \n \n Through this painting, I invite viewers to reflect on the concept of shelter not just as a place of safety, but as an inner refuge where we can find strength and healing through our connection with one another. In uncertain times, the spiritual shelter we offer and receive from each other becomes essential, guiding us toward unity, hope, and a brighter future.",

    "How it connects to the theme of Shelter": "This artwork explores the place I feel safest and at my best: playing a drawing game with my partner and housemates after dinner. As a London-based artist, I am fully aware of how privileged living in a comfortable home is, and have struggled to do so in the past: my monoprints often explore the theme of domesticity and intimacy as something special and to be treasured. The piece is also about the joy that creativity - even post-meal doodling - can bring. I intentionally left the monoprint blank in order to reveal the white paper of the print when depicting the paper in the scene - this emphasises the blankness of paper sheets and it's incredible potential as a technology. I think a true shelter not only protects you from discomfort and pain, but also fosters your strength and creativity.",

    "How it connects to the theme of Shelter": "This painting explores \"shelter\" as both a physical space and an emotional refuge, inviting the viewer to reflect on their own experiences of comfort, protection, and introspection. My intention was to create a piece that encourages personal engagement, allowing viewers to bring their own emotions and interpretations to the work rather than offering a fixed or literal representation. The muted tones were chosen to evoke feelings of reflection, peace and calm. The vertical streaks are evocative of the sense of being embraced or protected both emotionally and physically, while the lighter areas are suggestive of light filtering through a concealed space. I believe that an abstract approach, as opposed to a pictorial one, allows for greater personal connection. This allows viewers to relate to the theme of shelter by using their own experiences and feelings, free from the limits of literal imagery.",

Inspired by a personal tragedy, it reflects on the failure of a religious space and community—traditionally seen as a place of solace and protection—to provide true shelter, instead becoming the site of isolation and despair. The piece examines the complex role of community, highlighting how power and isolation can be wielded both positively and negatively within structures meant to support. The intersections of gender, self-identification, pain, and power further question how shelter, both physical and emotional, is experienced and accessed. Ultimately, the painting becomes its own form of shelter, offering a space for reflection, healing, and critique of communal and spiritual systems.",

The resonance of this frequency guided me, allowing me to tune into deeper emotional currents, shaping the painting’s expression of both resistance and release.\n \n \n \n The work embodies the delicate balance of healing relationships, where protection and vulnerability coexist. Like a shelter, relationships offer both strength and fragility. Resistance teaches us the need for boundaries, while release provides the freedom to heal and transform.",

In this nearly abstract piece, the patchwork pattern of a quilt evokes this collection. The piece is painted very loosely which is intended to indicate the uncertainty of chronic illness which makes holding on to this collection difficult. Illness is often thought of as temporary, and all of the societal supports we have assume that illness will be followed by recovery. However, chronic illness is not temporary, and navigating it is like being stuck in places that are intended to be passed through. It’s in this inhospitable, changing landscape that we carve out a home and find joy.",

Each ape, cloaked in a unique disguise, mirrors the masks we wear in our daily lives—layers of identity crafted to shield, obscure, and reveal who we are. In creating these figures, I take shelter behind their forms, allowing them to embody my own need for protection, my instinct to hide and yet connect. The soft, intricate crochet work juxtaposes the primal strength of the ape, emphasising vulnerability in the act of masking. These apes are not just creatures of disguise; they are sanctuaries, bearing witness to the tension between our need for shelter and our desire to be seen.",

    "How it connects to the theme of Shelter": "A girl bears witness to a storm through drawing and so connects with the part of herself that is most alive. People hurry to take shelter but she stands under the forked light in the intermittent rain. Her refuge is in being an artist. This happened to me on a sultry day when a storm came and shook the torpid air. Storm is the moment for change when you abandon what shelters you but also holds you back. I continue to work with Storm in paint after a long period of darkness and hesitation.",

    "Content": "*Kong Wang* is a collaborative video work created by artist Chengyu Yao and musician Xiaoran Han. The title is derived from a unique concept in the I Ching and traditional Chinese astrology, where \"Kong Wang\" signifies disappearance, non-existence, looseness, or diminished influence, often carrying ominous connotations in cultural interpretations. In this piece, Chengyu Yao documents eerie occurrences within a fictional residential space built using the game development software Unity. She transforms her real-life paranormal experiences into an independent game, then adapts the in-game events into a faux documentary format. The film explores her journey through mysticism, charting her evolution from an initial fear of the supernatural to a place of clear understanding and acceptance. This project is both an experimental venture into the ninth art—*video games*—and an encounter between reality and an otherworldly dimension, blending the lines between digital storytelling and spiritual exploration.

    "How it connects to the theme of Shelter": "In \"Kong Wang\", the concept of \"shelter\" becomes complex and multifaceted. The work, inspired by the artist's real-life paranormal experiences, explores a home stripped of its safety, becoming a site of fear and disconnection. The fictional residential space created in Unity mirrors this unsettling reality, where the absence of physical and emotional shelter evokes profound vulnerability. Yet, \"Kong Wang\" also reflects the journey toward reclaiming a sense of safety. The artist documents her transformation from fear to understanding, showing that shelter can exist within oneself through self-awareness and spiritual growth. The work’s title, derived from the \"I Ching\", underscores themes of impermanence and instability, challenging the traditional notion of home as a sanctuary.",

    "How it connects to the theme of Shelter": "It's a painting of three people standing picking their noses at a bus shelter. It is about the way people evade the responsibility to think for themselves by taking refuge in the mundane, the tawdry, the banal. In this shelter people can feel that they are part of what Heidegger called a 'They'. They feel comfortable here, because they are doing what they are required to do, and what everybody else expects them to do. When the No. 69 bus they are waiting for arrives, it will take them to Hell via Normalcy. But they are more or less dead anyway, so it doesn't matter. Shelters aren't always good places. The picture shows a dog defecating in the background. Generally speaking, there is something unpleasant going on in the background of most people's lives, but it doesn't do to dwell on these things too much.",

At her core, a once-vibrant shelter—trees, home, and safety—bleeds away, embodying the loss of stability and warmth. The home is incomplete, its structure disintegrating, just as my sense of belonging and safety has been stripped away.\n \n \n \n The process of creating this piece was as much about catharsis as it was about expression. I used rough crosshatching and raw, jagged lines to reflect the chaos and destruction that war imposes. The fiery hues of yellow and red clash with the cold, muted tones of blue and black, underscoring the violence of conflict and its chilling aftermath.\n \n \n \n This artwork captures the emotional void left by war—how it transforms vibrant life into a barren shell.

The tiger’s decision to come out and stare directly at the viewers shows its curiosity and bravery, but also its increasing vulnerability as natural habitats are destroyed. By depicting this transition from a place of safety to one of exposure, the painting conveys the fragility of wildlife, it serves as a stark reminder of the urgent need to protect these animals and their diminishing refuges.",

    "Content": "I am a working class artist. I make art and work full time in homeless services in Birmingham. Due to Birmingham City Council being bankrupt I am seeing huge changes in services and a massive reduction in the support offered to homeless people as well as preventing people becoming homeless. In this surreal digital collage, hands are dangling or holding homes just out of reach of the people who need them. I have added a helter-skelter ride. The ride represents the confusion and disorder that people in need face, daily. The long wait to access small amounts of affordable social housing is depressing and an obstacle to thriving. People become obsessed with finding accommodation, hence several figures having houses as heads. In this piece I am referencing Gee Vauchers's Feeding Of The Five Thousand artwork for the anarcho punk band, Crass. I wanted to recreate a snapshot of a corrupted space and system that breeds conflict. This is a very personal response to the situation homeless people deal with on a daily basis, a reaction to the housing crisis in the UK in general and how, as someone who has been working to alleviate this problem for over a decade, I feel the situation is becoming increasingly desperate.",

    "How it connects to the theme of Shelter": "This work is inspired by my career in homeless services in Birmingham. For over a decade I have been supporting people to get out of homelessness and to find a home they can call their own. Having no home, no shelter is devestating and creates a level of trauma and disconnection from the rest of society. Housing is such a basic need and for many it is elusive. The hands holding the houses represents how out of reach affordable housing is. The helter-skelter ride shows people going round and round in the system only to be spat out at the bottom and left to start all over again. My work references Gee Vaucher's artwork\n \n Feeding Of The 5000 for the anarcho punk band, Crass. My piece is a surreal representation of the conflicted and corrupted system that does not protect the most vulnerable in society.",

    "Content": "The Dolls House is a collaborative artwork created in response to the theme of \"shelter\" for Outside In's National Open Exhibition 2024. Artists from ArtWorks SY, adults who have a learning disability, are autistic or both, began the project by exploring what \"shelter\" means to them. Through brainstorming and collaging about places, moments, and experiences that evoke safety or escapism, the concept of \"dream rooms\" emerged—spaces filled with elements that individually bring comfort and joy. This idea laid the foundation for The Dolls House.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n The Dolls House features rooms designed and created by ten artists: David, Gillian, Lisa, Craig, Chris, Corey, Diane, Amy, Asa, and Daniel. Each room reflects a unique theme, ranging from WWE to food, landscapes, birds, football, boy bands, and glitter. The artists crafted miniature furniture and decorative items tied to their themes, incorporating personal touches such as dancing monkeys on beds, painted landscapes, and peacock-feather embellishments.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n On the top floor, a gallery room showcases miniature versions of the artists’ works created at ArtWorks, the day care service they attend. This dedicated space celebrates the pride and excitement the artists feel about exhibiting their creations. It includes a diverse range of pieces, from individual projects to large collaborative canvases.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n At the center of the house is a larger room representing ArtWorks itself, where creativity flourishes daily. Surrounded by the individual rooms of the artists, this space reflects the vibrant, supportive environment that inspires them. Encircling the entire house is a colorful autumnal garden, inspired by the views of nature from their South Yorkshire art space and referencing the gardening work many of the artists contribute to within their community.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n The Dolls House encapsulates the unique styles and personalities of the artists. While conceived as a response to the theme of shelter, it has evolved into a celebration of creativity and a meaningful expression of what being artistic means to each contributor.\n \n \n \n You can watch a video tour of The Dolls House at this YouTube link : https://youtu.be/r75hBFRQt2I?si=WK3jGT8UUXC4dQ9k",

We sat and discussed themes of 'shelter', which led the artists to make miniature versions of their 'dream' rooms: somewhere to escape to and full of things that they find comforting. Each of our artist's distinct artistic styles and personalities are on display: from a bedroom with monkeys dancing all around, to a room inspired by a burning love for WWE. Set against the backdrop of the autumnal leaves and trees present at our art space in South Yorkshire, The Dolls House also features a miniature gallery of the artist's original work and a central room inspired by ArtWorks, the day care service that all the artists attend and that brings them together to nurture their own creativity.",

    "How it connects to the theme of Shelter": "This artwork is a A3 pencil and graphite drawing of a person surrounded by ‘nature’. Being surrounded by nature inside or outside the home makes me feel connected to myself and safe within my mind. Being in nature creates a mindful environment for me and helps me process my thoughts and feelings. Walking in the woods with my dog, I feel sheltered by the trees from the busy world around me and it gives me a sense of calmness.\n \n \n \n I usually create my drawings digitally but I used traditional methods of drawing with pencil and graphite to create a more mindful experience creating this work. Filling in parts of my drawing piece my piece took time but allowed me to connect with the message and themes of the piece.",

There are smaller egg-like forms inside this slender and fragile form, sheltered by the horizontal bands of willow and brown paper. The mother form is precarious, and the eggs are too. This mother is doing her best to shelter the potential children inside of her. She is based on my mother but she is also me, and my grandmother and all the mothers before us.\n \n When I was pregnant with my own second child, we were made homeless for a short while but thirty years later I still worry that I cannot keep my children safe out in the world.",

    "Content": "Greg’s Hut and Other Stories (2024) submission for the Outside In National exhibition open call ‘Shelter’.\n \n Mixed media painted collage with vintage ephemera. Comprising a panel piece 27.94 x 35.56 and two miniature paintings set within a book cover frame 19 x 12.7. Miniature painting sizes: 7 x 7, 9.5 x 6.3. Framed in a shadow box frame 62 x 44.5.\n \n Video https://vimeo.com/1034750287/f6212bcae6\n \n Responding to the theme of Shelter, I initially wanted to create an artwork about Greg’s Hut bothy on the Pennine Way trail. It is the highest bothy in England. Greg’s Hut was named in memory of mountaineer John Gregory who died in a climbing accident in the Alps in 1968. It is a humble two roomed stone cottage located on Cross Fell in the Northern Pennines. Greg’s Hut was originally built as a blacksmith’s and to house miners working in the lead mines on the local hills in the 1800s.\n \n These days it is used by local shepherds and is a welcome sight and place of shelter for those who hike this 268 mile route, as this entry into the Bothy book from 2006 illustrates;\n \n “13th -14th Jan. I have never been so grateful for a hut in the middle of nowhere, leaning 45 degrees in order to stay upright, pelting hail and sleet and 90 mph winds.”\n \n (Extract from MBA Newsletter no.207, Summer 2007 by Greg’s Hut Association secretary Val Harrison)\n \n The Pennine Way was the first national trail in England, allowing public access to the countryside. All thanks to decades of campaigning led by activist and journalist Tom Stephenson. 2025 will mark 60 years since that fight was won and the trail first opened. With this in mind I felt it was important to develop my idea for this project to include other landmarks and stories about this significant trail and the stunning landscape it traverses.\n \n This mixed media work features a variety of landmarks on the trail including Greg’s Hut, various cairns that mark the path and an impressive stone shelter at the summit of Cross Fell, the highest point of the Pennines. The hill, once believed to be haunted by demons, was also known as Fiends Fell. According to legend, Saint Augustine banished the evil spirits from Cross Fell and erected a cross and altar on the summit. The cross shaped stone shelter that is now situated there gives protection to walkers from the strong Helm winds associated with this particular peak. Interestingly, the Helm wind is the only named wind in the UK. It is a strong north-easterly wind that blows down the southwest slopes of Cross Fell. It is thought that the shrieking sound of the Helm wind was historically mistaken for the evil demons haunting the hill.\n \n In my search for vintage paper ephemera relating to the Pennine Way and the area of Cross Fell where Greg’s Hut is situated, I was lucky enough to find vintage maps and literature about the Pennine trail for sale online and in my local antiquarian bookshop. Most of the vintage papers used in this artwork had belonged to a man called Jim Roberts, a keen hiker and cyclist, who sadly passed away earlier this year. These included a first edition copy of a book called The Pennine Way by Kenneth Oldham, published in 1960. Select pages from this book are used within this piece, including the hardback cover that I deconstructed and transformed into a frame for the two miniature paintings.\n \n As a person who could never make the journey along this remarkable trail myself due to disability, my personal connection is with the South Pennine area around Calderdale and the borderlands of Lancashire where I have lived for over twenty years. We are fortunate to have stunning views of the Pennines from our current home and our last home in Hebden Bridge. In the years when I was bedridden (2009 - 2014) I had views from my bed that I know were essential to my survival. When my life became an endless stretch of stasis, I could watch the seasons change and drink in the incredible beauty of the land as a form of meditation. Often I dreamed about running through the woodland on those steep hills of the Calder Valley. Eventually I recovered enough to get to walk short sections of the trail in our local area. In the panel piece, I have included a section of a vintage map that actually has our last home on it; the 39 Mile mark on the Pennine Way. A small symbol of my love of this place and how it feeds my soul.\n \n This landscape continues to enchant me. Including the parts my feet will never touch.\n \n \n CREDITS:\n \n I originally started searching for photos with a Creative Commons licence because it wasn’t possible to go to Cross Fell to take my own pictures to inform this artwork. I hit on gold when I discovered a fascinating website https://www.geograph.org.uk/\n \n The Geograph Project is an open collaborative community project with over 13,000 contributors.

The shelter they do find often puts them in extremely vulnerable situations ,and they are often situated close to combat zones.\n \n In my own family displacement happened due to war and interment in concentration camps or work camps during times of severe economic decline. This experience created reliquaries of stories and objects such as a sunflowers seeds in a pocket of a political prisoner camp survivor, keys to a home, or earth from a homeland to be placed in a burial plot of a displaced person. These are passed down through the generations\n \n I have used text, muted palate, found objects, soft sculpture and patchwork to explore the themes of protection, gesture , smell, when making the armaments and explore the idea of longing to return from situations of displacement. Referencing and juxtaposing textile traditions and motif from traditional British textiles to Afghan war rugs. Creating an edginess between the visual floral motif and the landscape of the conflict zone.Mickey mouse peers from under the handkerchief in the left hand corner chatting with the wagging dog!\n \n The central text in black felt references the idiom “Home Sweet Home” and is a phrase that originated from a popular song in 1823.It references the pleasures of returning home ,and signifies it as the centre of stability and comfort in a family and community life. The text is placed on a patchwork background of handkerchiefs dating back a 100 years. Delicate in the nature, lace edged , stained with lip stick and spots of blood, signifying the distress of displacement and acting as a vessel for the collection of tears from the trauma of being forced into temporary shelter. Held in the cloth are microscopic structures of dried tears ,emotions and natural pain killers released when the body is under stress.\n \n My soft sculpture armaments include drones, hand grenades, tanks and guns. They challenge the sanctity of the Home Sweet Home in their position in the composition. They are designed and made of furnishings,children's clothes,and cloth that references the global origins of the 120 million people across all continents who seek shelter due to war. They are the fragments of cloth found and scavenged in conflict zones where domicide has destroyed homes and community infrastructure. Being used , as currency ,to wear, ,shrouds for the dead , built into shelters or burnt for heat by the displaced. The soft sculpture hands use symbolic , gesture, to represent the displaced seeking shelter. The hands are held up in symbol of surrender / peace, to signify the protected right civilians should have. Their fingers are covered in cloth from around the world. The wrists wear protective charm bracelets or an eye with found objects such as keys,a shooting star, dice, four leaf clover, suitcase, St Christopher, good luck coin, boot, seed from a concentration camp, vial of soil from homeland, a wishing bone, cross, a chimney sweep, a lottery ticket, a rainbow, a Hamsa hand, a sixpence, a fairy, peace sign, and a horse shoe. Symbolising the element of chance and luck in the safety of the displaced when they leave on an unknown journey.\n \n All of the sculptures and frame are stuffed with dried lavender heads,the piece has a multi sensory scenographic presence in the gallery. It is visual, tactile and has scent from the stuffed lavender armaments and hands. This allows a move away from the traditional visual appreciation of the work ,where the art work enters to body to evoke an olfactory response to memory ,nostalgia and homeliness that the displaced hold in their memories and oral histories. This references the new use of systems such as Lavender AI technology that processes data taken from data bases, social media and surveillance to determine targets such as buildings , and people. This greatly expands the bombing capabilities, increases civilian casualties and collateral damage .It is a primary driver of domicide when used in urban war zones where many civilian and infrastructure targets are destroyed. It is a example of a human machine interface that takes the decision making out of target identification.",

There has been a lot of speculation about why they were made, especially by male historians, which reflects our continued misunderstanding around birthing, sick and recovering bodies.\n \n \n \n This Sheela births a digital native, hanging from them via an umbilical cord.\n \n \n \n Birthing bodies are the first shelter we enter when we come into physical existence in this world. They should be the safest place to be but structural oppression and inequality disturbs the most ancient shelter we have, the womb. Our desire of shelter as we continue to grow into adulthood will always be rooted in our experience of the original shelter of the womb and will imprint on our lives forever.

This object, discovered in a serene coastal area, symbolizes contrasts: the freedom of the outside world versus the confinement within. The cage is covered with jute sack fabric—its rough, abrasive texture evoking discomfort and unease—juxtaposed with soft, warm wool that recalls the comforting feeling of being wrapped in a blanket on a cold day. The sack fabric holds personal meaning, as it was originally used at my wedding to collect letters and gifts and was once owned by another bride. While I have always disliked its texture, it symbolizes the transient nature of homes in our nomadic journeys to discover ourselves. Just as the sack has passed through different hands and served different purposes, our concept of shelter evolves as we move through life, carrying fragments of memory and identity from each place we inhabit.\n \n \n \n This piece reflects my journey from an abusive, unwelcoming home—one I wished to escape—to a nurturing and safe environment where I can simply be myself. The work draws attention to the duality of shelter: it can be a space of comfort and refuge or a place of pain and invisibility. By combining materials and textures that evoke both tension and warmth, I aim to create a mixed-media sculpture that invites viewers to reflect on their own definitions of home. Through interaction—walking around, looking inside, and touching the piece—the viewer is encouraged to consider the contrasts of their own experiences and choose what kind of shelter they seek today.",

    "Content": "A Safe Place\" is a multimedia sculpture that invites viewers into a sanctuary of softness, light, and refuge. Exhibited as part of Neuk Perspectives at Patriotshall Gallery and Space for Wellbeing at the Findhorn Bay Festival in 2024, the piece is a delicate exploration of safety, healing, and the artist’s personal journey. The sculpture features a paper mache structure illuminated by battery-powered lights, which lend it a magical and comforting glow. Within its cozy cocoon-like form, a sleepy creature rests peacefully, evoking a sense of being held and protected from the outside world.\n \n This work serves as a physical manifestation of the artist’s internal space, created from a deeply personal place. As an autistic person and survivor, the aim was to evoke the feeling of sanctuary, counteracting the fear that often overshadows life. The sculpture represents a solidified refuge—an imaginative, unchanging place that persists even as thoughts and emotions shift. The soft lighting and the enclosed space of the sculpture offer an intimate, calming experience that feels both tender and safe.\n \n Materials used in the sculpture hold significant personal meaning for the artist, including thistledown from a witch and smooth stones gathered from the beach. These elements connect the artist to her surroundings, imbuing the piece with a deep sense of love, nature, and transformation.\n \n The installation is described by Zinzi Buchanan as \"a fluffy, homely, bedroom-like world\" that offers a \"visceral experience of being held, suspended above the world and its sometimes suffocating gravity.\" It resonates strongly with the ethos of Space for Wellbeing, where the piece became a symbol of comfort and acceptance, providing a much-needed space for emotional and sensory restoration.\n \n Creating \"A Safe Place\" has been an act of self-affirmation, a visual representation of the healing power of imagination. It is a quiet yet powerful statement about the importance of creating spaces where one can feel truly safe, whether through art or personal experience. The piece ultimately invites both the artist and the viewer to find solace and strength within the safe, soothing world it creates.",

    "How it connects to the theme of Shelter": "“A Safe Place” is a multimedia sculpture that invites viewers into a sanctuary of softness, light, and refuge. Exhibited as part of Neuk Perspectives at Patriotshall Gallery and Space for Wellbeing at the Findhorn Bay Festival in 2024, the piece is a delicate exploration of safety, healing, and the artist’s personal journey. The sculpture features a paper mache structure illuminated by battery-powered lights, which lend it a magical and comforting glow. Within its cozy cocoon-like form, a sleepy creature rests peacefully, evoking a sense of being held and protected from the outside world.\n \n This work serves as a physical manifestation of the artist’s internal space, created from a deeply personal place. As an autistic person and survivor, the aim was to evoke the feeling of sanctuary, counteracting the fear that often overshadows life.",

Her courage inspires me to keep trying, even when life is hard.\n \n \n \n This artwork is about my journey and how shelter is more than just a roof. It’s the people who help you and the dreams that guide you. With the support of Trinity Winchester and its art group, especially Ali Eales and David Keeping, I’ve found the confidence to share my work. They’ve shown me that real shelter is found in kindness and community.\n \n \n \n Kahlo’s Umbrella is about how art can protect and lift you, like an umbrella, offering comfort and hope during life’s storms.",

My mother coped with the challenges of motherhood and sheltered me from all of the circumstantial economic hardships and realities of the world around being a single mother, health issues and general growing up. So, this piece is a testament to my recognition of her sacrifice and how her acts of love made me who I am today. This is showcased through the symbolic collage, vs, me and my mother in the ‘warm’ child like drawn house. She sheltered me from the harsh realities of the world at her own expense to ensure that I could reach my full potential, never telling me that anything was impossible, even if social circumstances could have limited me. To me a shelter provides warmth and protection, and this is my strong mother, and I’m proud to call her my mom.",

The rusty, rigid coils, woven with the soft, natural honeysuckle, evoke the tension between vulnerability and resilience.\n \n The act of weaving becomes a meditative process of reclamation, transforming the cold, industrial frame into a protective shelter. This tactile process mirrors the journey of healing: reappropriating spaces tied to pain and finding refuge within oneself.\n \n By merging elements of nature with an object of domestic familiarity, Uproot explores how we create shelters—both physical and emotional—in the aftermath of trauma. It invites the viewer to consider how we reconstruct safety and belonging, even in spaces once defined by discomfort or harm.\n \n This work can be shown as a sculpture with complimentary photographs with my body inside the sculpture",

This painting expresses the deep sense of safety and solace I experience when I paint. It’s a space where I can create freely, guided by my instincts and unburdened by the expectations of society. My art is my sanctuary, offering me protection from the barriers I often face in the world.\n \n \n \n In society, I frequently encounter rejection, misunderstanding, and even bullying, which can leave me feeling isolated. My art becomes a haven from these challenges—a safe haven where I can explore, express, and exist authentically. It is a place where I am not judged, and where my emotions, thoughts, and creativity can flow freely. Through painting, I create a space that is mine alone, where I am not defined by societal norms or limitations.\n \n \n \n This painting reflects my philosophy and process as an artist. Art, to me, is not just a product; it is energy in motion. My work begins with raw, internal energy—emotional, mental, or creative—and transforms into a physical reality on the canvas. It’s a way to translate my inner thoughts and emotions into something tangible that others can perceive and experience. My art is a process of creating something meaningful and objective out of the subjective depths of my inner world.\n \n \n \n I believe that without exploration and a connection to one’s roots, there can be no meaningful destination. This belief shapes my philosophy and my artistic journey. My work embodies the idea of \"total direct identification,\" a concept I hold dear. It is the recognition that the mind’s energy creates everything physical. My art gives authority to the raw origins of thought—the foundational, unfiltered concepts that underpin everything in our reality.\n \n \n \n In this piece, I reflect my sense of shelter in the free-flowing energy of creation. It represents the safe space I find when I’m painting—a space of liberation, fulfillment, and harmony. It’s not just a retreat from external challenges but a space where I can tap into the very essence of existence and share it with the world.\n \n \n \n What does home mean to me?

    "How it connects to the theme of Shelter": "This photograph is part of a series taken during a recent trip to Wistman’s Wood, one of Britain's last remaining ancient temperate rainforests on Dartmoor, believed to date back to around 7000 BCE.\n \n \n \n Difficult to locate and access, I spent many hours here observing how this site changed with the weather and the emotions it evoked in me—experiencing a strong bodily connection with this ancient, sacred landscape.\n \n \n \n As a Deaf person who was denied access to sign language until I was a teenager, being outside in nature and studying landscapes through my artwork has provided a refuge from the mental health challenges I face as a result of this discrimination—a shelter from my inner storms.\n \n \n \n As I sheltered under the canopy of these trees, escaping the turmoil of a hostile and inaccessible world, I wondered who else had sought refuge and healing here in the centuries before.",

What unites us is the love and hope and common humanity ( the hand made mark of paint). The paint also symbolises an absence of being.. we know the mark has been made but where is the human: inhabited life?\n \n \n \n This comes with a small uv spot light that shines in to pick out the paint inside. It glows. The live glow seeps out from the edges and we can see it through the different transparencies and materials at the front.\n \n \n \n As the day progresses, the shadows change and move, the colours change. It is not static. And can be put up anywhere.",

I used pink because of the common associations with love, warmth, protection and humanity.\n \n This is a temporary shelter, just found objects ( found different pieces of acrylics) leant against the wall is a basic shelter for any animal or person. We make these shelters as children. Inside it is safe it gives a temporary respite to what is happening outside.\n \n We can enjoy looking at the formal elements and enjoy the magic as it changes as the time, day and place changes too.\n \n This is for everyone, everywhere and exists with hope in a recognised common humanity.",

After several days of conscientiously observing these birds, I felt a sense of dissonance between their calmness and my inner emptiness, because they have a home and I don't. I don't have it because it was taken away (I'm talking about Luhansk, occupied in 2014). They, in their close attachment to the place, seemed integral, inextricably linked to the space that surrounded them.\n \n \n \n I was deprived of my home. Now I am looking for a new one. But the feeling that I am in my place is not there, no matter how much I search. Is it even possible to find another home? And if it is, will my old wound ever heal?\n \n \n \n The act of swallowing swans becomes a metaphor for this desire to find a home. Envy of the swans, who have what I lack, makes me want to eat them. Perhaps by absorbing the idyll of those who have not lost their home, I will understand where mine is? This work opened up a new meaning for me: by eating the swans, they settled in me - not finding my home, I became it myself",

The swans symbolize attachment to a place, idyll, and belonging, all of which I have lost. By consuming them, I try to understand how to find a new home, and ultimately realize that, even without a physical home, I myself become a shelter — the swans have settled within me.",

For me, this piece is about more than the physical space, its about the emotional refuge that places like this can provide; the comfort, the memories. I wanted to suggest the presence of the medieval community that sought safety and solace here without resorting to the obvious or the cliché.

    "How it connects to the theme of Shelter": "The artwork represents myself at the age of 20 and the nine years I spent living in a traditional gypsy bender tent whilst travelling the country from county to county harvesting seasonal crops as an itinerant agricultural labourer whilst living in a travelling commune. The artwork includes the entirety of my possessions during this period which consisted mainly of tools and items essential to living in a temporary shelter which would be set up, lived in for a matter of weeks before being taken down, moved and set up again. I constructed the shelter from a frame made of hazel saplings, a plastic tarpaulin was used as a ground sheet with a canvas tarpaulin as a top sheet with another plastic tarpaulin as a top cover. My bed was set atop two pallets and my heat was supplied by a wood burning stove I made from an old oil can.",

    "How it connects to the theme of Shelter": "This painting is inspired by becoming a dad. At the time my partner was pregnant and we were both hoping we would have twins. I hoped it would be two boys called Ron and Don. I represented them as two different types of Sun. I believed that would be a way of identifying my two sons through their different brightness and warmth. Both equally as bright but one yellow-gold and the other orange-gold. I represented them as two fire arms, one automatic fire arm and the other a rifle. Representing their quickness as adult men. There is also the fruit that only exists in Sierra Leone, an apple that resembles the Adam’s apple of a man. And a grandfather clock which represents the memories I have of my grandfather, few houses in Sierra Leone still have grandfather clocks in them but they represent masculinity.",

While exposing my past youth, recall being physcial removed at a very young age from negleted home (shelter) taken into care. It was out of the frying pan into the fire, foster carers homes seemed bleak had to share a bed they did not seem to care and treated us pretty mean or even worse in their homes. More interested in the money those poor foster kids brought with them. A hospital respite brought along another temporary shelter over supposedly festive season presented with a toy doll, the press took their photos of children and soon left then the matron quickly removed the toys stating \" There only for show dear\". Eventually returned back after what seemed a long time for that child to the same (shelter) home but always felt insecure I never knew when might suddenly be taken away again this memory has always stayed.",

It demonstrates how ancient techniques, such as daub construction using naturally abundant materials like animal manure, etc can be adapted by Mans creative ingenuity using our uniquely developed hands to create basic shelters. To bridge the gap between ancient and modern methods, I incorporated cement and clay into the daub mixture, which represents contemporary building practices using mortar and brickwork.\n \n The sculpture itself is a pair of hands forming an ancient mud hut-style structure, symbolizing human capacity to shape our environment and create shelter from materials provided by nature. Hands also capable of holding each other in a warm protective embrace",

    "Content": "‘semi-detached’ is a photographic series where artist Meg Mosley presents herself as a solitary woman engaged in domesticity around the home. In this series Meg is focused on bringing cinematic tension to the mundane domestic activities she depicts. Meg sought permission to use the recently vacated 1960’s semi-detached period property after the death of her neighbours. As the building had been a genuine home Meg was able to expose every nuance left behind of a life lived, whilst elaborating on this with her own production design and styling for every room. Meg meticulously planned every camera angle and pose to create nuanced open-ended photographic narratives.",
